## Problem Statement
1.	Identify the top 3 cities with the highest number of customers to determine key markets for targeted marketing and logistic optimization. Which of the cities must be focused as a part of marketing strategies?
2.	Determine the distribution of customers by the number of orders placed. This insight will help in segmenting customers into one-time buyers, occasional shoppers, and regular customers for tailored marketing       strategies. As per the Engagement Depth Analysis question, what is the trend of the number of customers v/s number of orders? Also, which customers category does the company experiences the most?
3.	Identify products where the average purchase quantity per order is 2 but with a high total revenue, suggesting premium product trends. Among products with an average purchase quantity of two, which ones           exhibit the highest total revenue?
4.	For each product category, calculate the unique number of customers purchasing from it. This will help understand which categories have wider appeal across the customer base. Which product category needs more     focus as it is in high demand among the customers?
5.	Analyse the month-on-month percentage change in total sales to identify growth trends. During which month did the sales experience the largest decline? What could be inferred about the sales trend from March      to August?
6.	Examine how the average order value changes month-on-month. Insights can guide pricing and promotional strategies to enhance order value. Which month has the highest change in the average order value?
7.	Based on sales data, identify products with the fastest turnover rates, suggesting high demand and the need for frequent restocking. Which product id has the highest turnover rates and needs to be restocked       frequently?
8.	List products purchased by less than 40% of the customer base, indicating potential mismatches between inventory and customer interest. Why might certain products have purchase rates below 40% of the total        customer base? After running an analysis to identify products purchased by less than 40% of the customer base, it was found that a few products have lower purchase rates than expected. What could be a             strategic action to improve the sales of these underperforming products?
9.	Evaluate the month-on-month growth rate in the customer base to understand the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and market expansion efforts. As per last question, what can be inferred about the growth        trend in the customer base from the result table?
10.	Identify the months with the highest sales volume, aiding in planning for stock levels, marketing efforts, and staffing in anticipation of peak demand periods. Which months will require major restocking of        product and increased staffs?
